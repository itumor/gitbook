# FAQ

### **What is EasyBlock?**

EasyBlock is a protocol which enables users to invest in StrongBlock indirectly from Fantom Network, eliminating the high gas fees of the **Ethereum mainnet** and the expensive minimum investment requirement of StrongBlock through the process.

### **How much can I earn with EasyBlock, is it less than StrongBlock?**

StrongBlock rewards their nodes with a \~27.3% return each month, this means if the $STRONG price doesn't change you will be earning the same yield of **\~27.3% (minus the fees and expenses) per month**.

In order to have a better estimate of your earning you can take a look at our spreadsheet calculator which we update regularly:

It is important to note that it is possible for you to **even earn more than owning a** **StrongBlock Node**. As EasyBlock shares are only 10$ each you can compound your earnings more effectively.

For example, if you buy a Strong node you need \~100 days to buy another node (compound your earnings). On the other hand, even if you only purchase 10 EasyBlock shares you can buy 3 more each month and increase your earnings thanks to compounding **** instead of just getting **\~230% APR in terms of $STRONG**.

### How can I sell my shares?

The **Easyblock Shares** are not transferrable or tradable. This is because Strongblock nodes are also non-tradable assets.

### Is my gains affected by $STRONG price?

Yes, as Easyblock doesn't use its own token and do all the payments in **$USDC,** your earnings are correlated with **$STRONG** price and **ETH gas fees.**

### Are EasyBlock transactions transparent?

Yes, all our transactions are transparent and can be seen on the blockchain. You can visit the [Contracts page](broken-reference) to access relevant links to block explorer websites.

### **How can I invest in EasyBlock?**

First, you need to switch Metamask to Fantom Network; to do this you can just visit [easyblock.finance](https://easyblock.finance) and confirm the popup regarding the network switch.

Secondly, you need to transfer some assets to Fantom Network. If you are using a centralized exchange, you can buy $FTM and transfer it directly to your wallet. If you have assets in another chain you can bridge them using [anyswap.exchange](https://anyswap.exchange).

EasyBlock shares are sold in $USDC which is a stable coin. You can swap any of your assets to $USDC from [SpiritSwap](https://swap.spiritswap.finance/#/exchange/swap/FTM/USDC) or [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/swap).

When you have enough $USDC in your account for your desired number of shares, you can click the button "Buy Shares". Only for your first transaction, you need to also complete the "Approve" transaction before buying.

### **I bought my shares, now what?**

When people buy shares their investments are accumulated and when there is enough capital to buy a StrongBlock node they are transferred to Ethereum mainnet and the protocol buys a node. Those nodes generate revenue continuously, keeping in mind the running node count and gas fees this revenue will be bridged back to Fantom and distributed to users as $USDC. The rewards will directly be deposited into your wallets every Sunday.

If you are an early investor, keep in mind that because there will be a lower amount of nodes the protocol owns at first, because of gas fees, rewards will be distributed more infrequently. At this stage, you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/easyblock\_fin) to get announcements regarding reward distribution.

### **Are there any fees associated with EasyBlock?**

EasyBlock protocol doesn't take any fee for neither purchasing shares nor claiming rewards.

Only a 10% fee is taken from StrongBlock rewards for development, management, and marketing purposes.

### How frequently the rewards are getting paid and how the rewards **are** calculated?

With the current number of nodes we own, it is decided that we will pay the rewards each Sunday. The rewards will be directly deposited into your own wallet in **$USDC**.
