# Introduction



**EasyBlock** is a protocol running on **Fantom Network** which enables investors of all sizes to invest in StrongBlock Nodes. StrongBlock requires a minimum investment amount on average **5000 $** and runs on Ethereum Mainnet which has high gas fees. These conditions make StrongBlock inaccessible for most of the investors. On contrary, **EasyBlock** has a minimum investment amount of **10 $** per share and minimal gas fees.\
The amount generated from share sales is bridged to Ethereum Mainnet and used to purchase StrongBlock Nodes. Revenue generated from those nodes is bridged back to Fantom on optimal intervals and distributed to shareholders.

### How can you benefit from EasyBlock?

You can buy shares (**10$** each) and start earning **\~27.3%** monthly returns in terms of **$STRONG** (contrary to the popular information, Strongblock doesn't give 1% daily on average it is 0.91%) by owning parts of StrongBlock nodes. By compounding your earnings you can increase your earnings further.
