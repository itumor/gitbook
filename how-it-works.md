# How It Works?



* Investors buy shares from the protocol using USDC
* USDC is converted into wETH and bridge to Ethereum Mainnet using Anyswap
* ETH is converted into at least 10 STRONG
* STRONG is used to purchase new StrongBlock nodes
* At optimal rates (keeping in mind the gas fees), STRONG rewards are harvested
* STRONG is converted into ETH and bridged into Fantom Network
* ETH is converted into USDC&#x20;
* Rewards are automatically distributed into investor wallets
